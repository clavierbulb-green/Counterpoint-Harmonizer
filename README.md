A project with the goal to create a program that can generate a melody to
harmonize a given melody following the rules of species counterpoint.

So far, consists of a createCounterpoint() function that takes as input a
part and returns an upper melody that harmonizes the part.

Immediate Goals:
    -[] Counterpoint should begin and end on perfect consonances
    -[] Penultimate bar should contain leading-tone
    -[] Voices should not leap together into a perfect consonance
    -[] A voice should not leap into a unison
