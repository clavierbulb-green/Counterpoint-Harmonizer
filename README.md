A project with the goal to create a program that can generate a melody to
harmonize a given melody following the rules of species counterpoint.

A work in progress. So far, can generate an upper melody (counterpoint) that harmonizes a given melody (cantus firmus)in first species (note against note). 

The cantus firmus is harmonized only with consonances, parallel and hidden octaves and fifths are avoided and both voices cannot leap into a perfect consonance; further melodic considerations (i.e. avoiding: successive skips, repeating notes, outlining of dissonances, dissonant move into the leading tone etc.) will be addressed soon.
